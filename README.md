# Fraud Detection AI System

Final project for the Building AI course  

## Summary  
This project detects fraudulent transactions using machine learning. It analyzes transaction patterns and flags suspicious activities in real-time.

## Background  
Fraudulent transactions have become a significant problem in online banking and e-commerce.  
* Problem 1: Growing number of online fraud cases.  
* Problem 2: Lack of real-time detection systems.  
* Motivation: To build an AI-based tool that prevents fraud losses.  

## How is it used?  
The system integrates into payment gateways or banking platforms. When a transaction is flagged as suspicious, it alerts the user and blocks the payment.

## Data sources and AI methods  
We use anonymized financial transaction datasets and apply supervised ML methods such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.  

## Challenges  
Avoiding false positives while still catching real fraud cases.  
Ensuring data privacy and ethical AI use.  

## What next?  
Expand the system with deep learning models and deploy it in a real-time environment.

## Acknowledgments  
Inspired by fraud detection systems used in financial technology.
