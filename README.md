project title - Fraud Detection Project

Final project for the Building AI course

 Summary

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using AI and machine learning. By analyzing transaction data, we aim to identify suspicious activities and reduce financial losses caused by fraud.  
Building AI course project

 Background

Fraudulent transactions are a major concern in banking and online payments. Billions are lost globally each year.  
This project is important because:  
* It improves financial security for businesses and customers.  
* Fraud detection helps banks prevent losses.  
* Personally, I find fraud detection interesting because it combines AI, security, and real-world impact.

 How is it used?

Fraud detection systems are used by:
* Banks and financial institutions.
* E-commerce platforms.
* Payment gateways.

The system flags suspicious transactions for further investigation. It can run in real-time, analyzing each transaction and alerting security teams.

Data sources and AI methods

The project uses publicly available datasets (e.g., [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)) and applies machine learning models such as:
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Neural Networks

AI methods:  
- Supervised Learning  
- Feature engineering  
- Model evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score  

Challenges

* Imbalanced datasets: Fraudulent transactions are rare compared to normal ones.  
* Risk of false positives: Incorrectly flagging legitimate transactions inconveniences customers.  
* Ethical considerations: Ensuring user privacy and secure handling of financial data.

What next?

Future improvements could include:  
* Adding deep learning models for better accuracy.  
* Real-time fraud detection integration with APIs.  
* Using explainable AI (XAI) to make predictions transparent.
