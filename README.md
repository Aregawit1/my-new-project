AI-Powered Fraud Detection System
Final project for the Building AI course
 Summary
This project detects fraudulent transactions using machine learning. By analyzing transaction patterns, it predicts whether a transaction is likely to be fraudulent in real time. (Building AI course project)
 Background
Fraudulent transactions are a huge problem in banking, e-commerce, and online payments.
This project addresses:
High financial losses due to fraud.
Difficulty detecting fraud in real-time.
Reducing false positives that frustrate genuine customers.
I chose this topic because online fraud is increasing globally, and AI can significantly improve fraud detection efficiency and accuracy.
How is it used?
The system processes transaction data and flags suspicious transactions.
Steps:
1. Input transaction details (amount, time, user behavior patterns).
2. AI model evaluates transaction risk.
3. Output: "Fraudulent" or "Legitimate" with confidence score.
Users:
 Banks and financial institutions.
 E-commerce platforms.
 Payment gateway companies.

Data sources and AI methods
Data Source: Public datasets (e.g., [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud))
AI Methods:
   Logistic Regression (baseline model)
   Random Forest Classifier
   Neural Networks for complex pattern detection
   Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest
Code snippet:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
prediction = model.predict(X_test)
```
Challenges
This project does not:
Guarantee 100% fraud detection (minimizing false negatives is still challenging).
 Cover insider fraud or complex money-laundering schemes.
Ethical considerations:
 Risk of false positives harming genuine users.
 Need for transparency and avoiding algorithmic bias.
 What next?
Future steps:
 Implementing real-time fraud detection APIs.
 Integrating with banking systems.
 Using advanced deep learning models (LSTMs for sequential transaction data).
Skills needed: API development, deployment on cloud platforms, advanced AI expertise.
